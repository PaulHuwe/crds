# This script is intended to be run manually,  paradoxically at 
# points which are known to be "safe".  Safe is when:
#
# 1. It's OK for the default operational context to change.
#
# 2. It's OK for the CRDS cache config area to change because
#    there is little chance of observing a partial update with
#    bestefs or another sync.
#
# 3. This script won't conflict data transfers in  another 
#    crob-based sync.

# Use an flock to prevent multiple concurrent syncs, safe or unsafe.  

# The intent of this organization is that "safe_sync" (elsewhere in a cron)
# does the heavy lifting of data transfer, and consequently, since no new rules
# or references are downloaded during unsafe_sync, unsafe_sync should update
# configuration in 10-20 seconds.  This is not however guaranteed, it's
# possible new files can be archived between the last safe_sync and this
# unsafe_sync...  in which case they'll download here, possibly taking minutes
# or hours.  So unsafe_sync has to be run with some awareness that it is safe
# with respect to local pipeline operation and new remote archive deliveries...
# or addditional undesired latenencies will be introduced.

# Make CRDS cache config area writable before syncing to allow an update
# This will update the default context as well as awareness of bad files.
