# usage:  safe_sync 

# This script is intended to be run in a cron job at a relatively high rate,
# say once every 10 minutes.  It renders the config area of the CRDS cache
# readonly, so it will not update the config area, and any bestrefs running in
# parallel processses won't see partial updates to the config area or perform
# their own (successful) updates either.

# The main purpose of this script is to perform bulk data transfers of new
# references and rules which are not yet in operational use.  This script will
# not update the operational context so running it will not put the newly
# downloaded files into effect, it just pre-caches them. New files should
# become sync'able as soon as they are archived at STScI.  The default
# operational context is changed by running unsafe_sync.

#
# Use an flock to prevent multiple concurrent syncs, safe or unsafe.  Even
# though sync starts only every 10 minutes, it may continue to run for hours if
# a large batch of files simultaenously becomes available.  Prevent concurrent
# syncs from messing up *referece and rules* transfers with a lock.  
#
# Make CRDS cache config area read-only before syncing to prevent asynchronouns
# (with respect to other syncs or bestrefs) updates.  Leave it that way on
# script exit.
