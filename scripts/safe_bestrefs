# This script is intended to be run in parallel with multiple pipeline bestrefs
# and a concurrent cron "safe_sync".  The config.lock is intended to provide
# exclusion from the "unsafe_sync" which updates the default operational
# context and CRDS cache configuration area.

# CRDS_LOCKS has to be set to a file system and directory where flock actually
# works, possibly not CRDS_PATH.

setenv CRDS_LOCKS  $CRDS_PATH

# Make CRDS cache config area readonly before bestrefs to ensure that
# bestrefs does not update the config area itself.

flock ${CRDS_LOCKS}/config.lock --exclusive --command ( \
    chmod 444 ${CRDS_LOCKS}/config/{hst,jwst}/*
    python -m crds.bestrefs $* --update-bestrefs
);
